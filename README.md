## `[ML’ 22] Simple Linear Regression Assignment`
-----
--❖ In this assignment, you will use linear regression tools in Python to predict the house price of unit area given some information about the house such as the house ---age or the number of near convenience stores.
--❖ Find the best variable (X) that can be used to predict the price of unit area (Y).
--❖ Try all the variables for “X” and calculate the mean squared error for each trial.
--❖ Your code must show all six trials.
--❖ If a variable can not be used as it is, you must handle it first.
--❖ Assignment Deadline: Thursday 17/3/2022 11:59 PM
--❖ You are expected to deliver a .rar/.zip file on Microsoft Teams containing:
--1- Assignment1.py code file containing the code for the six models and prints the MSE for each model.
--2- Word file containing:
--- Your name, id, department
--- A table that summarizes the mean square error of each model
--- Your conclusion the best variable to use for this task.
